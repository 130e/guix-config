### Quotes :/
I love vim; I'm just as unproductive as before, but in a more efficient manner. Which means I have more time to also be unproductive.

It will be painful at first, and painful at last

Vim actually feels natural to people who use Vim

Emacs takes a lifetime to learn. So the sooner you start, the longer it will take

People don't quit emacs. They just die at some point

I spend more time customizing my computer than using it
